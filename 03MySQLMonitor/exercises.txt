1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?
	The MySQL database(s) reside on a Server and client applications access the database(s) 
	to perform database operations such as reading and storing information.


2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (We’ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)
	Either help SELECT or
	help Data Manipulation --> help SELECT


3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and usingthe monitor in batch mode?
	In interactive mode commands are typed directly into the monitor itself and executed interactively.
	In batch mode commands are placed in a file and stored for later execution.  The "SOURCE" command is used 
		to execute the sql stored in the  file.


4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?
	These are Monitor program start-up options
		user: specifies the user name the Monitor will use to connect to the MySQL server
		password: at MySQL cerver set-up, if the above user was given a password, it can be provided as an 
			  option at Monitor start-up.  (If a password was provided and if it is not provided as a
			  Monitor start-up option, the Monitor will ask for the password before allowing use of the
			  Monitor.)
		database: tells the Monitor which database on the MySQL server to use without the need for the Monitor
			  user to specify it in a USE command.
