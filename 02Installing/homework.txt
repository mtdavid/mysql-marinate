Homework for Chapter 2 of Learning MySQL (2006 edition), from p. 94:

Exercises:
1) What is command completion?
   Some sort of command line thing.  Nothing useful for us gui users.  :-)

2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install"), or compiled methods?
   Package?  Tarball??  Is this some Linux-speak?  I'm a non-Command Prompt Windows guy.  
   
3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?
   Verify the MD5 checksums match.
   Downloaded nullriver's winmd5sum program, but didn't use it for WAMP install.

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?
   1) Click Start button, right-click on Computer and click Properties.
   2) In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab.  (Say Yes to User Access Control pop-up.)
   3) In the Advanced section, click the Environment Variables button.
   4) In System variables section scroll down, highlight the Path variable, and click the Edit button. 
      Add the mysql.exe directory to the Path


Additional Exercises (not in the book): 
1) Document how you installed MySQL and any issues you came across with installation. 
   (The goal is to be easy to install it again on a similar machine.)
   I installed Apache, PHP, & MySQL using WAMP -- not covered in the Learning MySQL text book.
   I ran into one problem... I didn't copy down the root password on initial install so I had to uninstall/reinstall.

2) Document where important files should be.
   C:wamp\wampmanager.exe
   C:wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.4.4\conf\httpd.conf
   C:wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.6.12\my.ini
   C:wamp\bin\php\php5.4.16\php.ini
