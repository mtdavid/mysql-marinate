1. When would you use a weak entity?

     An entity is considered weak when it cannot exist without having a relationship with another entity.  This 
         relationship provides context for the weak entity.


2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?

     If the thing is of interest to the database, has components of it's own, or has multiple instances to be 
         tracked, then it's an entity.  Otherwise it's an attribute.


3. Alter and extend the music database ER model so that it can store compilations, where a compilation is an album 
   that contains tracks by two or more different artists. Explain what you changed and why.
