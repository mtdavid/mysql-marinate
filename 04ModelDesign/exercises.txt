Let's try this again...

1. When would you use a weak entity?

     (I've hung around a lot of data geeks in my time, but I never heard anyone talk about strong & weak entities.)
     It appearrs an entity is considered weak when it needs a relationship with another entity to provide context and 
         that "identifying relationship" must exist - (must be a one-to-one relationship with it's parent entity).


2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?

     Better?  This is a strange question as it really depends on the "thing" we're talking about.  If the thing is of 
     interest to the database, has components of it's own, or has multiple instances to be tracked, then it's an entity.  
     Otherwise it's an attribute.  (Each is only "better" when it's used correctly.) 


3. Alter and extend the music database ER model so that it can store compilations, where a compilation is an album 
   that contains tracks by two or more different artists. Explain what you changed and why.

     See Diagram4_11.jpg file
        - ERDs created using MS Visio
     

4. Create an ER diagram for an online media store and explain your choices (e.g. why did you make X an entity and Y a relationship) using the following requirements:
 
     See Diagram4_11.odg file


 - There are two types of product: music CDs and video DVDs.
 - Customers can buy any number of each product.
 - For each CD, store the title, the artist’s name, the label (publisher), 
   and the price. Also store the number, title, and length (in seconds) 
   of each track on the CD.
 - For each video DVD, store the title the studio name, and the price.

Tables 4-1 and 4-2 contain some sample data to help you better understand 
the requirements.

Table 4-1. Video DVDs
Title			Studio			Price
Leon—The Professional	Sony Pictures		$21.99
Chicken Run		Dreamworks Video	$19.99

Table 4-2. Music CDs
Title	Artist	Label	Price
Come Away With Me	Norah Jones	Blue Note Records	$11.99
Feels Like Home		Norah Jones	Blue Note Records	$11.99
The Joshua Tree		U2		Island			$10.99
Brothers in Arms	Dire Straits 	Vertigo			 $9.99

Table 4-3 contains a sample list of music CD track titles and length in 
seconds for the CD with the title “Come Away With Me” by the artist 
Norah Jones.

If you are using Visio, Mike Murphy points out that there is a stencil by 
Daniel Harris that worked for him at 
http://www.visiocafe.com/downloads/various/DanielHarris/Chen_ER.zip

This directory also contains a Diagram4_11.odg file with Diagram 4-11, for use in question 3, and
as a model for question 4.
The .odg file was created on Open Office, but all compatibile programs can be seen at:
http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/odg

Or you can just hand-draw diagrams for questions 3 and 4 and take a picture, as in the Diagram4_11.jpg file.

DO NOT USE MySQL Workbench for these diagrams. Those are not true E-R diagrams with proper symbols and notation.
